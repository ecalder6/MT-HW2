8 <unk> <unk> That <unk> Donald <unk> Is For Real
<unk> have tried to label him a flip @ - @ <unk> .
<unk> have dismissed him as a joke .
<unk> some are holding out for an implosion .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald <unk> down from atop the polls , it hasn &amp; <unk> ; t worked ( yet ) .
<unk> of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s lead at double <unk> , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s nomination chances .
<unk> course , it &amp; <unk> ; s still early in the election cycle .
<unk> of this is to say that <unk> is likely to win the Republican nomination .
<unk> point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry &amp; <unk> ; s lead was giving way to a rising Herman <unk> , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
<unk> there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like <unk> Bush &amp; <unk> ; s <unk> <unk> and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s staying power and beginning to <unk> their dollars to topple him .
<unk> are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate <unk> isn &amp; <unk> ; t just a passing phase :
<unk> &amp; <unk> ; s <unk> ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald <unk> announced his candidacy in mid @ - @ June , a <unk> University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate <unk> .
<unk> mid @ - @ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald <unk> .
<unk> three in 10 say they have a negative view .
<unk> these numbers hold up in early states .
A <unk> poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of <unk> .
Two @ - @ thirds of <unk> voters would be happy with <unk> as the nominee .
In a CNN / <unk> poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &amp; quot ; enthusiastic &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; satisfied &amp; quot ; if <unk> were the nominee .
<unk> two in 10 say they would be &amp; quot ; upset &amp; quot ; if he were the nominee .
<unk> Ben <unk> generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as <unk> ( 43 percent say they would be &amp; quot ; enthusiastic &amp; quot ; <unk> 40 percent who say the same of <unk> ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
<unk> <unk> with only 21 percent .
On the flip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &amp; quot ; dissatisfied &amp; quot ; or &amp; quot ; upset &amp; quot ; if establishment favorite <unk> Bush becomes the nominee .
A majority of Republicans don &amp; <unk> ; t see <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s <unk> as a problem .
While Donald <unk> has been widely criticized for his <unk> and insults , 52 percent of <unk> Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate <unk> has the right <unk> to be president , according to <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s <unk> News / Washington Post poll .
The same number holds in the first @ - @ in @ - @ the @ - @ nation <unk> state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to <unk> last week .
<unk> , 44 percent think he doesn &amp; <unk> ; t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 <unk> say his <unk> does not belong in the White House , according to <unk> / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their <unk> <unk> , Republican voters think <unk> is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the <unk> nomination , four in 10 said <unk> was the best bet , according to a CNN / <unk> poll out last week .
That &amp; <unk> ; s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on <unk> Bush in late July .
<unk> disclosure : <unk> voters haven &amp; <unk> ; t had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination , <unk> only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
<unk> , it shows that a plurality of <unk> voters see <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s campaign as plausible .
<unk> if Republicans rallied around another candidate , <unk> still <unk> almost everyone .
<unk> pundits point out that the <unk> field is likely contributing to <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s lead , while anti @ - @ <unk> support is be spread <unk> among more than a dozen other candidates .
But a <unk> University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothetical head @ - @ to @ - @ head <unk> between <unk> and most other Republican candidates , <unk> almost always <unk> majority support .
He leads <unk> <unk> by 13 points , <unk> <unk> by 14 points , <unk> by 15 points , <unk> Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John <unk> and Chris <unk> by 33 points each .
He &amp; <unk> ; s in a dead heat with <unk> <unk> .
The only candidate who <unk> him ?
Ben <unk> would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head @ - @ to @ - @ head .
A bare majority of Donald <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s supporters say they &amp; <unk> ; ve made up their minds .
A new <unk> / <unk> poll out on <unk> shows that just more than half of voters who support <unk> say they have locked in their votes .
<unk> , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to <unk> candidates .
<unk> , <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider <unk> Ben <unk> , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for <unk> .
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with <unk> on immigration .
<unk> since Donald <unk> called immigrants from Mexico &amp; quot ; <unk> &amp; quot ; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
<unk> are worried that <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s <unk> will drive crucial <unk> voters away from the Republican Party and damage <unk> efforts .
But according to <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s new <unk> / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with <unk> on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald <unk> will remain too .
<unk> with government is climbing to new highs .
Donald <unk> and Ben <unk> now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
Six in 10 Republicans in <unk> &amp; <unk> ; s new <unk> / Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
<unk> they are angry at Washington , too .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> / Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent &amp; quot ; <unk> &amp; quot ; and 21 percent &amp; quot ; mad as hell . &amp; quot ;
